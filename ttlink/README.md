# USB-TTL Adapter

Simple USB adapter to connect devices like LXNAV Nano loggers or Oudie. Even
though these devices have a standard micro/mini USB sockets, they do not talk
USB protocol with glider electonics. Instead, they use TTL signal. This adapter
uses CH340G chip to convert USB protocol to TTL.
